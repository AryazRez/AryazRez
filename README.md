👋 Hi, I’m Aryaz

I work at the intersection of applied AI, data systems, and regulated environments.

I have 15+ years of experience in quality, compliance, and digital transformation within the life sciences, and I recently completed an MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence. My focus is on designing and evaluating AI-enabled systems that hold up under real world constraints such as data integrity, reproducibility, safety, and governance.

### How to read this GitHub

This GitHub reflects three phases of my work.

#### Academic foundations
Projects completed during my graduate program, focused on core machine learning and NLP concepts, modeling techniques, and evaluation. I keep these public as reference points for how my approach has evolved.

#### Translation to real world constraints
Independent projects applying AI techniques to life sciences and other regulated datasets, with an emphasis on system design, data quality, and failure modes.

#### Ongoing experimentation and systems thinking
Current and future work exploring modern AI tooling, orchestration patterns, and automation workflows. These projects focus less on novelty and more on tradeoffs, durability, and judgment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Current focus

- Applied machine learning and LLM systems

- Agentic workflows and orchestration

- Cloud native AI tooling across AWS, Azure, and GCP

- MLOps, monitoring, and reproducibility

- AI design in regulated or high stakes environments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🌟 Featured project

#### FAERS Adverse Event Analytics Pipeline
Independent, post degree project building a GxP oriented analytics pipeline on FDA FAERS data. Includes Snowflake based data modeling, full lineage and auditability, and Power BI dashboards. Designed to demonstrate how AI and analytics can be applied responsibly in pharmacovigilance and other regulated settings.
